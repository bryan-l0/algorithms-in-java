Really badly written code.  
No really.

Point.java has extra methods compared to the regular class.  
BruteCollinearPoints.java takes Point[] input and finds whether 4 random points are collinear by bruteforcing.  
FastCollinearPoints.java takes Point[] input and uses a sort to find all line segments, formed by 4+ points, that are collinear.

Both have bugs, are slow, and are generally bad. Wanted to move on to the next thing.
