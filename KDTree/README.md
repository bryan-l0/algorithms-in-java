2d-trees with a square map of (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1).

Both classes find points that are within a certain rectangular area, and the closest point to a selected point.

PointSET.java solves it by bruteforcing.

KdTrees.java solves it by building a 2d Trees data structure, and recursively searches for both results.
