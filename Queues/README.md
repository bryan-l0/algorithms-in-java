Some functions currently aren't constant time big Oh, and code isn't that clean. 

Deque.java is a doubly linked list with front and back add and remove methods.
RandomizedQueue.java is an array based data structure that has a randomized remove method.
Permutation.java randomizes the input data, by RandomizedQueue.java, and outputs them randomized.

May come back one day to figure this out but probably not :)
